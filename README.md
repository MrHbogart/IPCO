# IPCO EF7 Pollution prediction

This project is to predict pollution factors of EF7 CVVT engine based on data derive from censors such as engine speed,
torque, angle of camshaft and some other factors.

data needed to design and train this deep learning model provided by engine test group at Iran Khodro Engine R&D and Manufacturing Co.

based on these valuable data, we have designed a Deep Learning model with Keras on Tensorflow
